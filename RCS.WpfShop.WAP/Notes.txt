Note that in Azure the package is standardly generated on _GenerateAppxPackage, while in VS that is only explicitly.

For that reason the AppxPackageDir has to be applicable in the Azure environment. 
Even though that publication may not be used, the directory will be created if possible. 
So at least make it relative.

There have been inconsistencies in 'Any CPU' versus 'AnyCPU'. 
The way configurations are displayed in Visual Studio's GUI, versus how they are set in the projectfile, versus the OutputPath. 
Be aware of that.

On Azure MSbuild explicitly needs  /p:Configuration.
