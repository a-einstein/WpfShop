#### Purpose
* Creating a working desktop application for test and demo purpose based on WPF.
* Manage the code by Git and GitHub. Some changes, branches, and merges are deliberately created for this reason.

#### Prerequisites
* The application assumes the presence of my [AdventureWorks services](https://github.com/a-einstein/AdventureWorks/blob/master/README.md), to which a service connection should be configured.

#### Notes
* This is a near equivalent of my [PortableShop](https://github.com/a-einstein/PortableShop).
* For the time being the data service is configured locally. It may be made available on Azure again in the future. 

#### Aspects
* C# + XAML.
* Prism.
* MEF.
* Regions.
* MVVM.
* Make use of an Azure service.
* Client-server.
* WCF + SSL.
* Asynchronisity.
* Globalized resources.
* Basic styling.
* Unit testing.
