  TODO >> Decrease.
  
  maxReceivedMessageSize is increased x 100 arbitrarily.
  Note that a whole overview table is retrieved.
  Pictures in there may be a problem too.
  
  maxArrayLength is increased x 100 arbitrarily.
  This seems to be needed for large pictures in details.
  
  Note there may be a problem with the virtual drive of a project not being mapped.
  Use machine name to be visible in Fiddler.
  
  Note that comments within serviceModel get lost when using the configuration editor.
